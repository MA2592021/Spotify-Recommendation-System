# Spotify-Recommendation-System
- We will have 3 tasks to finish our Spotify Recommendation System Project with deploying it <br>
- Tasks:
    - Task1: Feature Engineering
    - Task2: Building ML Model
    - Task3: Deploying ML Model

## Task Details 
- Deadline Date: 9/14/2022 <br>
- Deadline Time: 9:00 AM EG, 12:30 AM IST

- You are required to add at minimum two modifications to the feature engineering of this dataset
    - Feel free to check your notebook regarding this task and add any modification which was not done in this example notebook
    - Feel free to contact your team leader if you want to ask about anything

- Recommendations
    - You may use `boxcox technique` to handle the skewness of the numerical data (but remember it only accepts positive data)
    - You may use `PCA technique` in different manner rather than dimensionality reduction
    - You may use different way than `correlation technique` to get the best features from the dataset
    - You may use `one hot encoding technique` regarding categorical features (yes, no) rather than (1, 0)
    - You may use one/many of the `object` columns and convert them into category `int` using `label encoding technique`
